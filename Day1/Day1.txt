Payment System using HyperCore

- Blockchain as DB is the hypercore view or it's just my view

- Soni's idea :- Having to saving the transactions in temp dir then verifying the transactions by mapping. 

    Question:- 

    1.  Who would verify the transactions once both parties write the transactions into temp dir?

        - I think it would be opposite parties only and no third party invovled in verifying, though no idea if it's a good thing 
          or not. Then we do need to charge any amount of fees or transactions?
